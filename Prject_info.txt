8) On google search Uttar Pradesh voter list: http://164.100.180.4/searchengine/SearchEngineEnglish.aspx

In converted html : Epic no is intact with font = AAAAAF+Arial; font-size:10px and starting with ANB or GLT or UP

9) Method3: Parse epic no. data from converted pdf and scrap corresponding data from CEO website.

Result: 
Total EpicNo = 779
